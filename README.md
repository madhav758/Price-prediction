# Price-prediction
This project aims to predict housing prices using multiple factors such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, parking, and additional features like air conditioning, guest rooms, and furnishing status. The dataset has been preprocessed, analyzed for multicollinearity using VIF, and refined by removing insignificant features based on p val.
